Disables the theme update checking and notification system.

It's important that you keep your WordPress themes up to date. If you don't, your blog or website could be susceptible to security vulnerabilities or performance issues. If you use this plugin, you must make sure you keep yourself up to date with new releases of your themes and update them as new versions are released.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip the ZIP file and drop the folder straight into your `wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why would I want to disable the theme update system? =

Most people will not want to (and should not) disable this feature. It's a fantastic feature of WordPress and I'm fully in support of it. However, administrators who maintain multiple installations of WordPress on behalf of other people (eg. clients) may not want theme update notifications to be shown to the users of these installations. This plugin is for them.

= Can I disable the plugin update notifications too? =

Yes. Please see the [Disable WordPress Plugin Updates](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/disable-wordpress-plugin-updates/) plugin.

= Can I disable the WordPress core update notifications too? =

Yes. Please see the [Disable WordPress Core Update](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/disable-wordpress-core-update/) plugin.
